Scenario: This dataset is provided by the Paralyzed Veterans of America (PVA). PVA is a not-for-profit organization that provides programs and services for US veterans with spinal cord injuries or disease. With an in-house database of over 13 million donors, PVA is also one of the largest direct mail fund raisers in the country. The dataset comprises results of PVAâ€™s fund raising appeals in 1997. A mailing exercise has been conducted by sending mail to PVA donors who were on the PVA database and have been donated previously. The mail included a gift of personalized name address labels plus an assortment of 10 note cards and envelopes. The donors subsequently replied through the reply envelopes with their donations.
